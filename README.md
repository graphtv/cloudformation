# GraphTV - CloudFormation

## Warning

Running this CloudFormation Template _WILL_ incur costs. Most (depending on traffic) reside in the AWS Free Tier.

You are responsible for understanding what the template provisions and how much it will cost you.

That all being said, the goal of this project was to make a scalable web app with an eye toward minimal and scaling costs. A site with no viewers should basically be free.

## Build Status

Coming soon!
